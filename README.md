This is the website prelaunch.
It needs last minute, (a) --> link fixes for the footers (#note: 'github', 'whatsapp', 'facebook', 'instagram')
                                 (b) --> addition of developer and collaborator links (#note: new division required)
                                 (c) --> removal of pages which are currently redundant, such as speakers, archive section
                                 (d) --> addition of indexes and shorthand links (#note: new division required)
                                 (e) --> addition of the Jamnabai Narsee School icon 
                                 (f) --> addition of the redirection snippet for the 'https' secured version to always be shown to the user

We are hoping the website will finally be ready to be published by Monday, 16th December, 2018
