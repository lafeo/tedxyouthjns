This is the final redone website!

There are some error pertaining to the allignment. Such as the red footer in the About page is relative I didn't find an alternative to make it 
non-relative.
None the less, I am have made some adjustments. Finally buddy check the fadeOut and In background for the header on the main page, the footer
for both the pages and finally make it responsive!
